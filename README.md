# VirtualMouse

## Description

**VirtualMouse** is a project that allows users to control their computer's mouse using hand gestures captured by a webcam. This project leverages computer vision techniques, specifically **mediapipe** and **OpenCV**, to detect hand movements and map them to typical mouse functions. It provides a **touchless interface** for interacting with your computer, making it ideal for accessibility, presentations, or simply adding a cool tech feature to your setup.

The project detects various hand gestures in real time and converts them into mouse actions like cursor movement, clicks, scrolling, and zooming. It's cross-platform, and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Virtual Mouse Usage Guide

- **Move the Cursor** by simply pointing your **Index finger**.
- To perform a **Left Click**, **bend your Index finger**.
- A **Double Click** is done by bending both your **Index and Middle fingers** together.
- Make a **Fist** to trigger a **Right Click**.
- Use all four fingers (**Index, Middle, Ring, and Little**) to **Zoom In**.
- To **Zoom Out**, use just three fingers (**Index, Middle, and Ring**).
- For **Scrolling**, position your **Thumb**, **Index**, and **Middle fingers** in a V-shape. Move them upwards to scroll up, and down to scroll down.
- A **V-shape** formed by the **Index** and **Middle fingers** can help you stay on the current option.

###### Prolonged Usage Notifications

To promote healthy usage and prevent strain from extended periods of interaction with the system, **VirtualMouse** includes a notification feature that alerts users if they have been using the system for too long. If the system detects that the user has been interacting with the virtual mouse for a prolonged period, a notification will pop up as a reminder to take a break. This feature helps reduce the risk of discomfort or repetitive strain injuries.
